;; - GetObject returns a realized byte[], which obviously requires as much memory as the response is big.
;;   For very large objects you might run into the issue where the JVM cannot access as much RAM as that.
;; - GetObject has an internal limitation which prevents loading data larger than Integer/MAX_VALUE.
